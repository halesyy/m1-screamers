# The M1 Screamers
Pushing to the border: multiprocessing, threading, scraping, and compute tests with Apple M1 Silicon & their Windows/Linux counterparts.

### Future Function Ideas:

* Print the first million numbers
* Threading a scrape and BeautifulSoup parse with adjustable threads
* Complex Jacobian mathematics, generating ecliptics, etc
* Million-iteration cryptography (SHA256, 512, XMR's algo, etc...)
* Video cut-and-render using moviepy (copy + hard encode)
* My personal y12 heavy-compute smart art functions (requires seperate project link, won't publish source here)
* My personal image re-interpretation functions
