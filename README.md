|-----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| M1        | Apple M1 MacBook Air, 8gb 256gb, 8 raw cores in Terminal | US$280 |
| PC        | Windows 10, i7-6700K @ 4.00 GHz (4 cores, 4 hyperthreaded) in Powershell | US$45 [(Google)](https://www.google.com/search?q=estimate+cost+for+apple+m1+chip) |

### 1-one-to-million.py

* M1 Python ~3.9.1: 1.78s
* M1 Python 2: 0.98s
* PC Python 3.8.5: 39.89

## 2-threaded-scraping.py

In the below test, there are two variables that can be changed: threads and how many are done at-once. If we choose to run 50 threads, this means we'll make 50 requests in total. If we do 10 at-once, it will perform these in 10-chunk batches. The at-once metric is important since it's a key value contributing to scrape performance for cloud-based systems or locally.

* M1 Python 3, 50 threads, 50 at-once: 0.53s
* M1 Python 3, 500 threads, 500 at-once: 3.14s
* M1 Python 3, 1000 threads, 1000 at-once: 22.19s
* M1 Python 3, 1000 threads, 100 at-once: 6.8s

* PC Python 3.8.5, 50 threads, 50 at-once: 0.53s
* PC Python 3.8.5, 500 threads, 500 at-once: 3.49s
* PC Python 3.8.5, 1000 threads, 1000 at-once: 7.12s
* PC Python 3.8.5, 1000 threads, 100 at-once: 6.9s

With these results, we 10x'd our required responses with only a 6x increase in time-to-serve. This says Apple's M1 threads are efficient with their thread-switching (something Python naturally struggles with).

But, there seems to be a max to this curve (of course). When we approach 1,000 threads and 1,000 at-once, we've stuffed the threads, causing a Pythonic ms-feedback loop where the threads forcibly keep switching without completing the whole request (my guess). But, when switching 1,000 threads to 100 at-once, we return to our agile speeds with 6.8 seconds.

### The takeaway from this test...

Don't stuff your threads. They DO enjoy their space. But, don't give them too much credit - they are M1's... don't need to be boring and go as low as your core count ðŸ˜‰

# The M1 Screamers
Pushing to the border: multiprocessing, threading, scraping, and compute tests with Apple M1 Silicon & their Windows/Linux counterparts.

### Future Function Ideas:

* Print the first million numbers
* Threading a scrape and BeautifulSoup parse with adjustable threads
* Complex Jacobian mathematics, generating ecliptics, etc
* Million-iteration cryptography (SHA256, 512, XMR's algo, etc...)
* Video cut-and-render using moviepy (copy + hard encode)
* My personal y12 heavy-compute smart art functions (requires seperate project link, won't publish source here)
* My personal image re-interpretation functions
